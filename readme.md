# vite-tetris

A dirty implementation of Tetris built with Vite, Typescript, and React.

Ive made this as a fun exercise to learn more react development.

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- Vite
- React
- Node


## Prerequisites

- Node.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/vite-tetris.git
   cd vite-tetris

1. Install dependencies:
        npm install

1. Run the development server:

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.


## Bugs

1. Will sometimes crash if tetrimino is rotated or stashed too close to the bounds of the grid.
